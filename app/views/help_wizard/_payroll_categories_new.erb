      <p>Payroll categories are components under which the emoluments are paid to the employees.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Provide a meaningful and recognizable name for each payroll category as you want it to appear in the employee payslips.</li>
        <li>Each payroll category is assigned a code (eg: Category - Basic Pay, Code - BASIC). The code will be the unique identifier of a payroll category. Payroll categories can have variable values based on formulas created using other payroll category codes. (eg: Health Allowance = Basic*0.10).</li>
        <li>Category Value: The category value defines how the amount for the category is to be calculated. It can be one of the following:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Numeric</b> - If the value is a numeric constant, use this option.</li>
          <li><b>Formula</b> - If the value of this category is based on other categories, use the codes of other categories and create a formula.</li>
          <li><b>Conditions</b> - If the value of the category is based on certain conditions.</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>

      <p><b>Note:</b> If a category is numeric and is not given any value or given a value of 0, all categories using this category will derive the value 0 when calculating payroll.</p>
      <p><b>Recommended:</b> It is good practice to connect all the formula based categories to employeeâ€™s gross pay (category code - GROSS) either directly or indirectly.</p>
