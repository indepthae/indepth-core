<div class="messages">Report Print Guideline: Since you’re using a customized header (E.g., you want to print on your school’s letter head) for your students’ CCE reports, the header section must not be more than 50 mm from the top of the first page. And since the header is only needed for the first page of the report, use blank sheets for the rest of the report.</div>
