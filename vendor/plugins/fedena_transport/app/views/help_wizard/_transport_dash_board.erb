  <p>
      Transport module now allows multiple ways to configure and run your vehicles. 
      Start with <%= link_to 'Basic Settings', {:controller => :transport, :action => :configurations}, {:target=>:_blank} %> 
      to setup configurations in the transport module according to your institution. 
      Ensure that no changes are required after the configuration is done. </p>
  <p>
    With this update, Passengers are no longer assigned to Vehicles. 
    A single vehicle may be assigned to more than one route. 
    It also captures much more information like Certificates, Maintenance details etc. 
    Finish setup of <%= link_to 'Vehicles', {:controller => :vehicles, :action => :index}, {:target=>:_blank} %>  to add missing details.
  </p>
  <p>
    Routes and Stops have been auto created after the update. 
    The sub routes have been converted to stops. 
    Make the necessary changes to the routes and stops as required before you start using the module again. 
    Finish setup of <%= link_to 'Routes', {:controller => :routes, :action => :index}, {:target=>:_blank} %> and 
    <%= link_to 'Stops', {:controller => :vehicle_stops, :action => :index}, {:target=>:_blank} %>
  </p>
  <p>
    If the same vehicle was used for more than one route, new routes have been created using the same name appended by a number. 
    Example a route with name Morning Route will be created as Morning Route, Morning Route1, Morning Route2 and so on. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Vehicles, Routes and Stops are created Academic Year wise. 
    Use the Import feature to copy settings from the current academic year to the next. 
  </p>
